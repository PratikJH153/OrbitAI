# Orbit AI

Orbit AI is a context-aware assistant designed for collaborative spaces like libraries, classrooms, and study environments. It passively listens, stores relevant chunks of conversations, understands environmental cues (like whiteboards, projectors, etc.), and provides personalized supportâ€”whether that means summarizing discussions, helping brainstorm, or guiding learning journeys.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), this project brings together real-time collaboration, intelligent assistance, and a smooth developer experience.
